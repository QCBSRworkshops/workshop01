R is an open source programming language and environment. It is designed for data analysis, graphical display and data simulations. It is one of the world’s leading statistical programming environments. 3.2 Why use R? R is open-source! This means that it is free, and constantly being updated and improved. It is compatible. R works on most existing operating systems. R can help you create tables, produce graphs and do your statistics, all within the same program. So with R, there is no need to use more than one program to manage data for your publications. Everything can happen in one single program. More and more scientists are using R every year. This means that its capacities are constantly growing and will continue to increase over time. This also means that there is a big online community of people that can help with any problems you have in R. 3.3 Using RStudio RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Basically, it’s a place where you can easily use the R language, visualize tables and figures and even run all your statistical analyses. We recommend using it instead of the traditional command line as it provides great visual aid and a number of useful tools that you will learn more about over the course of this workshop. It includes a console, and a syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution with tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. It integrates with R (and other programming languages) to provide a lot of useful features: RStudio supports authoring HTML, PDF, Word, and presentation documents RStudio supports version control with Git (direction to Github) and Subversion RStudio makes it easy to start new or find existing projects RStudio supports interactive graphics with Shiny and ggvis There are other IDE for R: Atom, Visual Studio, Jupyter notebook, and Jupyter lab 3.3.1 CHALLENGE 1 Open RStudio RStudio logo Note for Windows users: If the restriction “unable to write on disk” appears when you try to open R-Studio, right-click on your R-Studio icon and chose:“Execute as administrator” to open the program. 3.3.2 The RStudio interface When you open RStudio for the first time, the screen will be divided across three main Pane groups: Console, Terminal, Job group; Environment, History, Connections group; Files, Plot, Packages, Help, Viewer panes; and Script pane group Once you Open a Script or Create a New Script (File &gt; New File &gt; R script or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N), the fourth panel will appear. 3.3.3 The RStudio Console The first thing that you see to the left of the screen is the “console”. This is where we will be working for the rest of this Introduction to R workshop. Text in the console typically looks like this: output &lt;- &quot;This is the output&quot; output ## [1] &quot;This is the output&quot; Note 1: You always have to push “enter” for the input to run in the console. Note 2: People often wonder what the brackets in front of the output mean. They are there to help you locate “where” you are in the output. For example, if you ask R to output numbers between 1 and 10 and the output is on 2 rows, the bracket at the start of the 2nd row will help you understand at which value of the output you are situated: [1] 1 2 3 4 5 [6] 6 7 8 9 10 3.4 Errors and Warnings Often, the Console will output Errors and Warning messages. 3.4.1 Warning messages x &lt;- c(&quot;2&quot;, -3, &quot;end&quot;, 0, 4, 0.2) as.numeric(x) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] 2.0 -3.0 NA 0.0 4.0 0.2 Cautions users about an action, but still executes the function.

These keys actually allow you to scroll through your command history. This is a useful tool to go back and see what command you ran and if you might have made a mistake in it. This is always a useful tool to quickly alter previous commands you ran and to re-run them in a slightly different way. 4.1.3 CHALLENGE 4 What is the area of a circle with a radius of 5 cm?

However, it can get tiresome to always write the same code down in the R console, especially if you have to use some values repeatedly. This is where the concept of object becomes useful. R is an object-oriented programming language. What this means is that we can allocate a name to values we’ve created to save them in our workspace. An object is composed of three parts: 1) a value we’re interested in, 2) an identifier and 3) the assignment operator. The value can be almost anything we want: a number, the result of a calculation, a string of characters, a data frame, a plot or a function. The identifier is the name you assign to the value. Whenever you want to refer to this value, you simply type the identifier in the R console and R will return its value. Identifiers can include only letters, numbers, periods and underscores, and should always begin with a letter. The assignment operator resembles an arrow (&lt;-) and is used to link the value to the identifier. The following code clarifies these ideas: # Let&#39;s create an object called mean_x. The # symbol is # used in R to indicate comments. It is not processed by R. # It is important to add comments to code so that it can be # understood and used by other people. mean_x &lt;- (2 + 6)/2 # Typing its name will return its value. mean_x ## [1] 4 Here, (2 + 6) / 2 is the value you want to save as an object. The identifier mean_x is assigned to this value. Typing mean_x returns the value of the calculation (i.e. 4). You have to be scrupulous when typing the identifier because R is case-sensitive: writing mean_x is not the same as writing MEAN_X. You can see that the assignment operator &lt;- creates an explicit link between the value and the identifier. It always points from the value to the identifier. Note that it is also possible to use the equal sign = as the assignment operator but it is preferable not to because it is also used for other operations in R, which can cause problems when using it for assignment. Finally, imagine that the operator &lt;- and = follow their own order of priorities. y &lt;- x = 5 ## Error in y &lt;- x = 5: object &#39;y&#39; not found y = x &lt;- 5 y ## [1] 5 x ## [1] 5 5.2 Good practices in R code Name Try having short and explicit names for your variables. Naming a variable var is not very informative. Use an underscore (_), or a dot (.) to separate words within a name and try to be consistent! Avoid using names of existing functions and variables (e.g., c, table, T, etc.) Space Add spaces around all operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.) to make the code more readable. Always put a space after a comma, and never before (like in regular English). 5.2.1 CHALLENGE 5 Create an object (you decide the value) with a name that starts with a number. What happens? #### Solution {-} An object name that starts with a number will return the following error: unexpected symbol in \"your object name\". 5.2.2 CHALLENGE 6 Create an object with a value of 1 + 1.718282 (Euler’s number) and name it euler_value Solution euler_value &lt;- 1 + 1.718282 euler_value ## [1] 2.718282 What has happened in your RStudio window when you created this object? 5.2.3 The RStudio Environment The Environment panel shows you all the objects you have defined in your current workspace R TIP Using the Tab key allows auto-completion of names. It speeds up command entering and avoids spelling errors. For example, if you type eu and then press tab, you will see a list of objects or functions beginning with eu. Select euler_value (the object we just created) and press enter. The euler_value identifier now appears at the command line. If more than one element appears, you can use the arrow keys and press “Return” or use your mouse to select the correct one. 5.3 Data types and structure 5.3.1 Core data types in R Data types define how the values are stored in R. We can obtain the type and mode of an object using the function typeof(). The core data types are: Numeric-type with integer and double values (x &lt;- 1.1) ## [1] 1.1 typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; (y &lt;- 2L) ## [1] 2 typeof(y) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Character-type (always between \" \") z &lt;- &quot;You are becoming very good in this!&quot; typeof(z) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Logical-type t &lt;- TRUE typeof(t) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; f &lt;- FALSE typeof(f) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; 5.3.2 Data structure in R: scalars Until this moment, we have created objects that had just one element inside them. An object that has just a single value or unit like a number or a text string is called a scalar. # Examples of scalars a &lt;- 100 b &lt;- 3/100 c &lt;- (a + b)/b d &lt;- &quot;species&quot; e &lt;- &quot;genus&quot; By creating combinations of scalars, we can create data with different structures in R. Using R to analyze your data is an important aspect of this software. Data comes in different forms and can be grouped in distinct categories. Depending on the nature of the values enclosed inside your data or object, R classifies them accordingly. The following figure illustrates common objects found in R. 5.3.3 Data structure in R: vectors The first object is a vector. It is one of the most common objects in R. A vector is an entity consisting of several scalars stored in a single object. All values in a vector must be the same mode. The main modes in R are numeric, character and logical. Character vectors include text strings or a mix of text strings and other modes. You need to use \"\" to delimit elements in a character vector. Logical vectors include TRUE/FALSE entries only. A vector with a single value (usually a constant) is called an atomic vector. Before we look at how to create different types of vectors, let’s have a look at the generic method of creating vectors. If you recall what you have just learned, you will first have to identify some value you want to put in a vector and then link it to an identifier with the assignment operator (i.e. create an object). When you have more than one value in a vector, you need a way to tell R to group all these values to create a vector. The trick here is to use the c() function. Don’t worry, you will learn about functions pretty soon in one of the following sections. For now, just remember to put your values between parentheses next to letter c() in this format: vector.name &lt;- c(value1, value2, value3, ...). The function c() means combine or concatenate. It is a quick and easy function so remember it! Now that you know the generic method to create a vector in R, let’s have a look at how to create different types of vectors. # Create a numeric vector with the c (which means combine # or concatenate) function. We will learn about functions # soon! num_vector &lt;- c(1, 4, 3, 98, 32, -76, -4) # Create a character vector. Always use &#39;&#39; to delimit text # strings! char_vector &lt;- c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;) # Create a logical or boolean vector. Don&#39;t use &#39;&#39; or R # will consider this as text strings. bool_vector &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) # It is also possible to use abbreviations for logical # vectors. bool_vector2 &lt;- c(T, T, F) 5.3.3.1 Creating vectors of sequential values: The a:b takes two numeric scalars a and b as arguments, and returns a vector of numbers from the starting point a to the ending point b, in steps of 1 unit: 1:8 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7.5:1.5 ## [1] 7.5 6.5 5.5 4.5 3.5 2.5 1.5 seq() allows us to create a sequence, like a:b, but also allows us to specify either the size of the steps (the by argument), or the total length of the sequence (the length.out argument): seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 seq(from = 20, to = 2, by = -2) ## [1] 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 rep() allows you to repeat a scalar (or vector) a specified number of times, or to a desired length: rep(x = 1:3, each = 2, times = 2) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 rep(x = c(1, 2), each = 3) ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 5.3.4 CHALLENGE 7 Create a vector containing the first five odd numbers (starting from 1) and name it odd_n. Solution odd_n &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) OR odd_n &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2) odd_n ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 R TIP Use dput() function to obtain the reverse, i.e. the content of an object formatted as a vector. e.g. : odd_n &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) odd_n ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 dput(odd_n) ## c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) # The output can be copied-pasted to create a new object by # using the structure() function structure(c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 This demonstration might not be that convincing, but keep in mind that it can be very useful when you’re manipulating data. These functions are really useful to provide a reproducible example for a question on Stack Overflow for instance (see one more application in the part about data frames)! 5.3.5 Operations using vectors What you have learned previously about calculations is also valid for vectors: vectors can be used for calculations. The only difference is that when a vector has more than 1 element, the operation is applied on all elements of the vector. The following example clarifies this. # Create two numeric vectors. x &lt;- c(1:5) y &lt;- 6 # Remember that the : symbol, when used with numbers, is # the sequence operator. It tells R to create a series of # numbers increasing by 1. c(1:5) or 1:5 is equivalent to # x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) # Let&#39;s sum both vectors. 6 is added to all elements of # the x vector. x + y ## [1] 7 8 9 10 11 # Let&#39;s multiply x by y x * y ## [1] 6 12 18 24 30 5.3.6 Data structure in R: matrices We have learned that scalars contain one element, and that vectors contain more than one scalar of the same type! Matrices are nothing but a bunch of vectors stacked together! While vectors have one dimension, matrices have two dimensions, determined by rows and columns. Finally, like vectors and scalars matrices can contain only one type of data: numeric, character, or logical. There are many wasy to create your own matrix. Let us start with a simple one: matrix(data = 1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 6 ## [2,] 2 7 ## [3,] 3 8 ## [4,] 4 9 ## [5,] 5 10 matrix(data = 1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 3 5 7 9 ## [2,] 2 4 6 8 10 We can also combine multiple vectors using cbind() and rbind(): nickname &lt;- c(&quot;kat&quot;, &quot;gab&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;) animal &lt;- c(&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;) rbind(nickname, animal) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## nickname &quot;kat&quot; &quot;gab&quot; &quot;lo&quot; ## animal &quot;dog&quot; &quot;mouse&quot; &quot;cat&quot; cbind(nickname, animal) ## nickname animal ## [1,] &quot;kat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; ## [2,] &quot;gab&quot; &quot;mouse&quot; ## [3,] &quot;lo&quot; &quot;cat&quot; Similarly as in the case of vectors, operations with matrices work just fine: (mat_1 &lt;- matrix(data = 1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 (mat_2 &lt;- matrix(data = 9:1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 9 6 3 ## [2,] 8 5 2 ## [3,] 7 4 1 # The product of the matrices is: mat_1 * mat_2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 9 24 21 ## [2,] 16 25 16 ## [3,] 21 24 9 5.3.7 CHALLENGE 8 Create an object containing a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns, with values from 1 to 6, sorted per column. Create another object with a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns, with the names of six animals you like. Create a third object with 4 rows and 2 columns: in the first column, include the numbers from 2 to 5 in the second column, include the first names of four friends Compare them see what differences you can detect (despite their values) Remember that text strings must always be surrounded by quote marks (\" \"). Remember that values or arguments must be separated by commas if they are inside a function, e.g. c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"). Solution # Step 1: (step_1 &lt;- matrix(data = 1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 # Step 2 (step_2 &lt;- matrix(data = c(&quot;cheetah&quot;, &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;ladybug&quot;, &quot;deer&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot;, &quot;crocodile&quot;), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;cheetah&quot; &quot;ladybug&quot; &quot;monkey&quot; ## [2,] &quot;tiger&quot; &quot;deer&quot; &quot;crocodile&quot; # Step 3 step_3 &lt;- cbind(c(2:5), c(&quot;linley&quot;, &quot;jessica&quot;, &quot;joe&quot;, &quot;emma&quot;)) 5.3.8 Data structure in R: data frames Another important type of object you will use regularly is the data frame. A data frame is a group of vectors of the same length (i.e. the same number of elements). Columns are always variables and rows are observations, cases, sites or replicates. Differently than a matrix, a data frame can contain different modes saved in different columns (but always the same mode in a column). It is in this format that ecological data are usually stored. The following example shows a fictitious dataset representing 4 sites where soil pH and the number of plant species were recorded. There is also a “fertilised” variable (fertilized or not). Let’s have a look at the creation of a data frame. site_id soil_pH num_sp fertilised A1.01 5.6 17 yes A1.02 7.3 23 yes B1.01 4.1 15 no B1.02 6.0 7 no # We first start by creating vectors. site_id &lt;- c(&quot;A1.01&quot;, &quot;A1.02&quot;, &quot;B1.01&quot;, &quot;B1.02&quot;) #identifies the sampling site soil_pH &lt;- c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6) #soil pH num_sp &lt;- c(17, 23, 15, 7) #number of species fertilised &lt;- c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) #identifies the treatment applied # We then combine them to create a data frame with the # data.frame function. soil_fertilisation_data &lt;- data.frame(site_id, soil_pH, num_sp, fertilised) # Visualise it! soil_fertilisation_data ## site_id soil_pH num_sp fertilised ## 1 A1.01 5.6 17 yes ## 2 A1.02 7.3 23 yes ## 3 B1.01 4.1 15 no ## 4 B1.02 6.0 7 no Note how the data frame integrated the name of the objects as column names R TIP Here the dput() function in another example. dput(soil_fertilisation_data) ## structure(list(site_id = c(&quot;A1.01&quot;, &quot;A1.02&quot;, &quot;B1.01&quot;, &quot;B1.02&quot; ## ), soil_pH = c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6), num_sp = c(17, 23, 15, 7), ## fertilised = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;, row.names = c(NA, ## -4L)) # It&#39;s possible to rebuild the initial data frame (with # some associated metadata as the class of variables) by # copying and pasting the previous output: structure(list(site_id = c(&quot;A1.01&quot;, &quot;A1.02&quot;, &quot;B1.01&quot;, &quot;B1.02&quot;), soil_pH = c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6), num_sp = c(17, 23, 15, 7), treatment = c(&quot;Fert&quot;, &quot;Fert&quot;, &quot;No_fert&quot;, &quot;No_fert&quot;)), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;, row.names = c(NA, -4L)) ## site_id soil_pH num_sp treatment ## 1 A1.01 5.6 17 Fert ## 2 A1.02 7.3 23 Fert ## 3 B1.01 4.1 15 No_fert ## 4 B1.02 6.0 7 No_fert Other types of objects arrays and lists. An array is similar to a matrix but can have more than two dimensions. Arrays are usually used for advanced computation like numerical simulations and permutation tests. A list is an aggregation of various types of objects. For example, a list could include a vector, a data frame and a matrix in the same object. 5.4 Indexing 5.4.0.1 Indexing a vector Typing an object’s name in R returns the complete object. But what if our object is a huge data frame with millions of entries? It can easily become confusing to identify specific elements of an object. R allows us to extract only part of an object. This is called indexing. We specify the position of values we want to extract from an object with brackets [ ]. The following code illustrates the concept of indexation with vectors. # Let&#39;s first create a numeric and a character vector. # There is no need to do this again if you already did it # in the previous exercise! odd_n &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) # To obtain the value in the second position, we do as # follows: odd_n[2] ## [1] 3 # We can also obtain values for multiple positions within a # vector with c() odd_n[c(2, 4)] ## [1] 3 7 # We can remove values pertaining to particular positions # from a vector using the minus (-) sign before the # position value odd_n[c(-1, -2)] ## [1] 5 7 9 odd_n[-4] ## [1] 1 3 5 9 # If you select a position that is not in the numeric # vector odd_n[c(1, 6)] ## [1] 1 NA There is no sixth value in this vector so R returns a null value (i.e. NA). NA stands for ‘Not available’. # You can use logical statement to select values. odd_n[odd_n &gt; 4] ## [1] 5 7 9 # Extract all elements of the character vector # corresponding exactly to &#39;blue&#39;. char_vector[char_vector == &quot;blue&quot;] ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; # Note the use of the double equal sign ==. 5.4.1 CHALLENGE 9 Using the vector num_vector and our indexing abilities: Extract the 4th value of the num_vector vector. Extract the 1st and 3rd values of the num_vector vector. Extract all values of the num_vector vector excluding the 2nd and 4th values. Extract from the 6th to the 10th value. num_vector &lt;- c(1, 4, 3, 98, 32, -76, -4) Solution Extract the 4th value num_vector[4] ## [1] 98 Extract the 1st and 3rd values num_vector[c(1, 3)] ## [1] 1 3 Extract all values except for the 2nd and the 4th num_vector[c(-2, -4)] ## [1] 1 3 32 -76 -4 Extract from the 6th to the 10th value num_vector[6:10] ## [1] -76 -4 NA NA NA What happened there? What is that NA? 5.4.2 Indexing a data frame For data frames, the concept of indexation is similar, but we usually have to specify two dimensions: the row and column numbers. The R syntax is dataframe[row number, column number]. Here are a few examples of data frame indexation. Note that the first four operations are also valid for indexing matrices. # Let&#39;s reuse the data frame we created earlier # (soil_fertilisation_data) Extract the 1st row of the data # frame soil_fertilisation_data[1, ] # Extract the 3rd columm soil_fertilisation_data[, 3] # Extract the 2nd element of the 4th column soil_fertilisation_data[2, 4] # Extract lines 2 to 4 soil_fertilisation_data[2:4] We can subset columns from it using the column names: # Remember that our soil_fertilisation_data data frame had # column names? soil_fertilisation_data ## site_id soil_pH num_sp fertilised ## 1 A1.01 5.6 17 yes ## 2 A1.02 7.3 23 yes ## 3 B1.01 4.1 15 no ## 4 B1.02 6.0 7 no # We can subset columns using column names: soil_fertilisation_data[, c(&quot;site_id&quot;, &quot;soil_pH&quot;)] ## site_id soil_pH ## 1 A1.01 5.6 ## 2 A1.02 7.3 ## 3 B1.01 4.1 ## 4 B1.02 6.0 # And, also subset columns from it using &#39;$&#39; soil_fertilisation_data$site_id ## [1] &quot;A1.01&quot; &quot;A1.02&quot; &quot;B1.01&quot; &quot;B1.02&quot; 5.4.3 A quick note on logical statements R gives you the possibility to test logical statements, i.e. to evaluate whether a statement is true or false. You can compare objects with the following logical operators: Operator Description &lt; less than &lt;= less than or equal to &gt; greater than &gt;= greater than or equal to == exactly equal to != not equal to x | y x OR y x &amp; y x AND y The following examples illustrate how to use these operators properly. # First, let&#39;s create two vectors for comparison. x2 &lt;- c(1:5) y2 &lt;- c(1, 2, -7, 4, 5) # Let&#39;s verify if the elements in x2 are greater or equal # to 3. R returns a TRUE/FALSE value for each element (in # order). x2 &gt;= 3 ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE # Let&#39;s see if the elements of x2 are exactly equal to # those of y2. x2 == y2 ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE # Is 3 not equal to 4? Of course! 3 != 4 ## [1] TRUE # Let&#39;s see which values in x2 are greater than 2 but # smaller than 5. x2 &gt; 2 &amp; x2 &lt; 5 ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE # You have to write x2 twice. If you write x2 &gt; 2 &amp; &lt; 5, # you will get an error message. 5.4.4 Indexing with logical vectors We can use conditions to select values: odd_n[odd_n &gt; 4] ## [1] 5 7 9 It is also possible to match a character string char_vector &lt;- c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;) char_vector[char_vector == &quot;blue&quot;] ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; There are also ways in R that allows us to test conditions We can, for instance, test if values within a vector or a matrix are numeric: char_vector ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;green&quot; is.numeric(char_vector) ## [1] FALSE odd_n ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 is.numeric(odd_n) ## [1] TRUE Or whether they are of the character type: char_vector ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;green&quot; is.character(char_vector) ## [1] TRUE odd_n ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 is.character(odd_n) ## [1] FALSE And, also, if they are vectors: char_vector ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;green&quot; is.vector(char_vector) ## [1] TRUE 5.4.5 CHALLENGE 10 Explore the difference between these two lines of code: char_vector == &quot;blue&quot; ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE char_vector[char_vector == &quot;blue&quot;] ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; Solution char_vector == &quot;blue&quot; ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE In this line of code, you test a logical statement. For each entry in the char_vector, R checks whether the entry is equal to “blue” or not char_vector[char_vector == &quot;blue&quot;] ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; In this above line, we asked R to extract all values within the char_vector vector that are exactly equal to blue 5.4.6 CHALLENGE 11 Extract the num_sp column from soil_fertilisation_data and multiply its values by the first four values of the num_vector vector. After that, write a statement that checks if the values you obtained are greater than 25. Refer to challenge 9 to complete this challenge. Solution Extract the num_sp column from soil_fertilisation_data and multiply its values by the first four values of the num_vector vector. soil_fertilisation_data$num.sp * num_vector[c(1:4)] ## numeric(0) # or soil_fertilisation_data[, 3] * num_vector[c(1:4)] ## [1] 17 92 45 686 After that, write a statement that checks if the values you obtained are greater than 25.

Functions are tools that are there to simplify your life. They allow you to quickly execute operations on objects without having to write every mathematical step. Functions are usually pre-existing R code that are executed when used. They remove the need to create this code and to rewrite it every time you need it. To execute a function, you will need to call it. A function call is essentially a shortcut to the code of the function. To perform the function call you will need entry values called arguments (or sometimes parameters). After performing its operations, the function will then give you a return value. The command also must be structured properly, following the “grammar rules” of the R language (syntax). A function call is structured as follow: the name of the function, followed by parenthesis ( ). Inside the parenthesis, you insert all your arguments separated with commas. function_name(arg1, arg2, ...) Here is an example: sum(1, 2) Arguments are values and the instructions the function needs to run. Objects can be passed into functions: a &lt;- 3 b &lt;- 5 sum(a, b) ## [1] 8 On the last line, the output that appears is the return value of the function. In this case, it is the sum of a and b, 8. 6.1.1 CHALLENGE 11 Create a vector a that contains all numbers from 1 to 5 Create an object b with value of 2 Add a and b together using the basic + operator and save the result in an object called result_add Add a and b together using the sum function and save the result in an object called result_sum Compare result_add and result_sum. Are they different? Add 5 to result_sum using the sum function. Solution Create a vector a that contains all numbers from 1 to 5 a &lt;- 1:5 Create an object b with value of 2 b &lt;- 2 Add a and b together using the basic + operator and save the result in an object called result_add result_add &lt;- a + b Add a and b together using the sum function and save the result in an object called result_sum result_sum &lt;- sum(a, b) Compare result_add and result_sum. Are they different? result_add ## [1] 3 4 5 6 7 The operation on the vector adds 2 to each element. The result is a vector. result_sum ## [1] 17 The function sum() adds all values of a and b. It is the same as doing 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 2. The result is a number. Add 5 to result_sum using the sum function. sum(result_sum, 5) ## [1] 22 6.2 Arguments Arguments each have a name that can be provided during a function call. To provide an argument name during a function call, just enter it in the form name=value. log(8, base = 2) If the name of the argument is not provided, the order of the arguments does matter. log(8, 2) ## [1] 3 log(2, 8) ## [1] 0.3333333 If the name argument is provided, the order of the arguments does not matter. log(x = 8, base = 2) ## [1] 3 log(base = 2, x = 8) ## [1] 3 6.2.1 CHALLENGE 12 plot(x, y) is a function that draws a graph of y as a function of x. It requires two arguments named x and y. What are the differences between the following lines? a &lt;- 1:100 b &lt;- a^2 plot(a, b) plot(b, a) plot(x = a, y = b) plot(y = b, x = a) Solution plot(a, b) Plots the graph of b as a function of a. plot(b, a) Plots the graph of a as a function of b.The argument names are not provided, the order of the arguments matters! plot(x = a, y = b) Plots the graph of b as a function of a, same as plot(a, b). plot(y = b, x = a) Plots the graph of b as a function of a. The argument names are provided, the order of the arguments does not matter!

Ex : statistics, spatial analysis, plotting... Everyone can develop packages and make them available to other R users. They are usually available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) Currently, more than 18000 packages are publicly available. To install packages on your computer, use the function install.packages() install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) ## Installing package into &#39;/home/runner/work/_temp/Library&#39; ## (as &#39;lib&#39; is unspecified) Installing a package is required only once (but updated from time to time) but it is not enough to use its functions. You need to load the package once per R session before using it with the library() function. Let’s try using the function qplot() found in the ggplot2 package we just installed. qplot(1:10, 1:10) The package was correctly installed but we didn’t load it. Therefore, the execution of this code leads to the following error: Error: could not find function \"qplot\" To be able to use the function qplot() we need to load the package ggplot2 before. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) qplot(1:10, 1:10) Now the function is found and the execution of our code leads to the following graph: It is good practice to unload packages once we are done with them because it might conflict with other packages. Unloading a package is done with the detach() function and by specifying that it is a package: detach(package:ggplot2) 7.2 Getting help 7.2.1 Getting help with functions We’ve seen so far that R is really great and offers us a lot of functions to work with. Among all these functions, there are probably some that can do what we want. Now the problem is: how to find them? To find a function that does something specific in your installed packages, you can use the operator ?? (or the help.search() function). To perform a search, just type ?? and what you want to search. For example, let’s say we want to create a sequence of odd numbers between 0 and 10. We will search in our packages all functions with the word sequence in them. `?`(`?`(sequence)) This opens the following window (Note: the search result may vary depending on the packages installed on your computer): The search result contains two columns: On the left, we have the name of the function and the package in which we can find it in the format package_name::function_name On the right, we have the description of the function Usually, functions have names that are representative of what they do. This makes it easier to use. Remember this if you ever start to write your own functions! Here the result that interests us is base::seq, i.e. the function seq that can be found in the base package and that generates sequences. Note: the base package contains basic functions that load with R when you launch it and are therefore always available. 7.2.2 Help page of functions We will use the seq() function to generate our sequence. But how does it work? What does it do? How should I use it? To answer all these questions, we’ll try to find the help page of the function. For that, we will use the ? operator (or the help() function). To access the help page of a function, we enter the commage as follow: ?function_name So for the seq() function, we type: `?`(seq) This opens the following page: A help page usually contains the folowing elements and sections (Note: sometimes, the same help page is used for more than one function): On the top left corner, the name of the function and the package it belongs to in the format function{package} Description: a short description of the function(s) Usage: how to use the function(s), especially what are the name and order of the arguments. If a value is specified near an argument name, it means that a default value has been defined for this argument, which makes it optional to specify another value. If the argument is missing, the default value will be used. For example, if we do not provide a from argument, the sequence will automatically start from 1 Arguments: A detailed description of all the arguments and what is expected or required for the function to work correctly. Be careful! Here are listed all the arguments for all the functions described on the help page; not all arguments are available for all listed functions. For example, in this help page, the arguments from and to are not available for the function seq_along(). Details: Provide in depth details of the inner working of the function(s). Some specific cases can be discussed here or additionnal information provided. Value: Explains what the return value of the function is.
