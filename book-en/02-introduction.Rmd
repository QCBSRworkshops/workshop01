# Recognizing and using R and RStudio

## What is R?

-   R is an open source programming language and environment.
-   It is designed for data analysis, graphical display and data
    simulations.
-   It is one of the world's leading statistical programming
    environment.
    
## Why use R?

-   R is **open-source**! This means that it is free, and constantly
    being updated and improved.
-   It is **compatible**. R works on most existing operating systems.
-   R can help you create tables, produce graphs and do your statistics,
    all within the same program. So with R, there is no need to use more
    than one program to manage data for your publications. Everything
    can happen in one single program.
-   More and more scientists are using R every year. This means that its
    capacities are constantly growing and will continue to increase over
    time. This also means that there is a big online community of people
    that can help with any problems you have in R.

## Using RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Basically,
it's a place where you can easily use the R language, visualize tables
and figures and even run all your statistical analyses. We recommend
using it instead of the traditional command line as it provides great
visual aid and a number of useful tools that you will learn more about
over the course of this workshop.


## Challenge 1

Open RStudio

**Note for Windows users**: If the restriction "unable to write on
disk" appears when you try to open R-Studio, right-click on your
R-Studio icon and chose:"Execute as administrator" to open the
program.

**The console**

When you open RStudio, the first thing that you see to the left of the
screen is the "console". This is where we will be working for the rest
of this Introduction to R workshop.

Text in the console typically looks like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> output
[1] "This is the output"
```

Note 1: You always have to push "enter" for the input to run in the
console.

Note 2: People often wonder what the brackets in front of the output
mean. They are there to help you locate "where" you are in the output.
For example, if you ask R to output numbers between 1 and 10 and the
output is on 2 rows, the bracket at the start of the 2nd row will help
you understand at which value of the output you are situated:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
[6] 6 7 8 9 10
```
