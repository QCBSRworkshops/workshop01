# Recognizing and using R and RStudio

## What is R?

-   R is an open source programming language and environment.
-   It is designed for data analysis, graphical display and data
    simulations.
-   It is one of the world's leading statistical programming
    environment.
    
## Why use R?

* R is open-source! This means that it is free, and constantly being updated and improved.
* It is compatible. R works on most existing operating systems.
* R can help you create tables, produce graphs and do your statistics, all within the same program. So with R, there is no need to use more than one program to manage data for your publications. Everything can happen in one single program.
* More and more scientists are using R every year. This means that its capacities are constantly growing and will continue to increase over time. This also means that there is a big online community of people that can help with any problems you have in R.

## Using RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Basically,
it's a place where you can easily use the R language, visualize tables
and figures and even run all your statistical analyses. We recommend
using it instead of the traditional command line as it provides great
visual aid and a number of useful tools that you will learn more about
over the course of this workshop.

It includes a **console**, a **syntax-highlighting editor** that supports direct code execution with tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

It integrates with R (and other programming languages) to provide a lot of useful features:

* RStudio supports authoring HTML, PDF, Word, and presentation documents
* RStudio supports version control with Git (direction to Github) and Subversion
* RStudio makes it easy to start new or find existing projects
* RStudio supports interactive graphics with Shiny and ggvis

There are other IDE for R: **Atom, Visual Studio, Jupyter notebook, and Jupyter lab**

#### CHALLENGE 1

Open RStudio

![](images//Rstudio.png){width="200"}

**Note for Windows users**: If the restriction "unable to write on
disk" appears when you try to open R-Studio, right-click on your
R-Studio icon and chose:"Execute as administrator" to open the
program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The RStudio interface

When you open RStudio for the first time, the screen will be divided across three main Pane groups:

1. **Console, Terminal, Job** group;
2. **Environment, History, Connections** group;
3. **Files, Plot, Packages, Help, Viewer** panes; and
4. **Script** pane group

Once you *Open a Script* or *Create a New Script* (File > New File > R script or `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N`), the fourth panel will appear


## The RStudio Console
The first thing that you see to the left of the
screen is the "console". This is where we will be working for the rest
of this Introduction to R workshop.

Text in the console typically looks like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
sortie <- "Ceci est la sortie"
sortie
```

Note 1: You always have to push "enter" for the input to run in the
console.

Note 2: People often wonder what the brackets in front of the output
mean. They are there to help you locate "where" you are in the output.
For example, if you ask R to output numbers between 1 and 10 and the
output is on 2 rows, the bracket at the start of the 2nd row will help
you understand at which value of the output you are situated:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
[6] 6 7 8 9 10
```

## Error and Warning
Often, the **Console** will output **Errors** and **Warning** messages.

**Warning message**


```{r error=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
x <- c("2", -3, "end", 0, 4, 0.2)
as.numeric(x)
```

* Cautions users about an action, but still executes the function.
* There might be an issue with the input and/or the output.

**Error message**

```{r, error = TRUE}
x*10
```


* Informs the user that there is a problem that prevents the command from running.
* One needs to solve the issue in order to carry on

Google is your best friend in solving **Errors** or **Warnings**!
