# Using R as a calculator

The first thing to know about the R console is that you can use it as a calculator.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Arithmetic Operators
* Additions and Subtractions
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
1+1

10-1
```

* Multiplications and Divisions

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
2*2

8/2
```

* Exponents
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
2^3
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHALLENGE 2

Use R to calculate the following skill testing question: 

$2 + 16 * 24 -56$

#### Solution {-}
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
2 + 16 * 24 - 56
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### CHALLENGE 3

Use R to calculate the following skill testing equation:

$2 + 16 * 24 - 56 / (2 + 1) - 457$

*Pay attention to the order of operations when thinking about this
question!*

#### Solution {-}
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
2 + 16 * 24 - 56 / (2 + 1) - 457
```

Note that R *always* follows the order of priorities.

**R TIP**

Try using the "up" and "down" arrows to reproduce previous commands.
These keys actually allow you to scroll through your command history.
This is a useful tool to go back and see what command you ran and if you
might have made a mistake in it. This is always a useful tool to quickly
alter previous commands you ran and to re-run them in a slightly
different way.

### CHALLENGE 4

What is the area of a circle with a radius of 5 cm?

Recall : ${Area _{circle} = \pi r^2}$

#### Solution {-}
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
3.1416 *5^2
```

R also has many built-in constants like pi.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
pi * 5^2
```

You can find them by typing `?` and `Constants` (as in `?Constants`) and executing it!
