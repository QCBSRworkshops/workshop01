# Installing and using R packages

## Packages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packages are a grouping of functions and/or datasets that share a
similar theme. Ex : statistics, spatial analysis, plotting\...

Everyone can develop packages and make them available to other R users.

They are usually available through the [Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

Currently, more than 18000 packages are publicly available.

To install packages on your computer, use the function
`install.packages()`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Installing a package is required only once (but updated from time to
time) but it is not enough to use its functions. You need to load the
package once per R session before using it with the `library()`
function. Let's try using the function `qplot()` found in the
**ggplot2** package we just installed.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
qplot(1:10, 1:10)
```

The package was correctly installed but we didn't load it. Therefore,
the execution of this code leads to the following error:

`Error: could not find function "qplot"`

To be able to use the function `qplot()` we need to load the package
`ggplot2` before.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
qplot(1:10, 1:10)
```

Now the function is found and the execution of our code leads to the
following graph:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library("ggplot2")
qplot(1:10, 1:10)
```

It is good practice to unload packages once we are done with them
because it might conflict with other packages. Unloading a package is
done with the `detach()` function and by specifying that it is a
package:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
detach(package:ggplot2)
```

## Getting help

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting help with functions

We've seen so far that R is really great and offers us a lot of
functions to work with. Among all these functions, there are probably
some that can do what we want.

Now the problem is: how to find them?

To find a function that does something specific in your installed
packages, you can use the operator `??` (or the `help.search()`
function). To perform a search, just type `??` and what you want to
search. For example, let's say we want to create a sequence of odd
numbers between 0 and 10. We will search in our packages all functions
with the word **sequence** in them.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
??sequence
```

This opens the following window (*Note*: the search result may vary
depending on the packages installed on your computer):

![](images/searchseq1.png){width="400"}\

The search result contains two columns:

-   On the left, we have the name of the function and the package in
    which we can find it in the format `package_name::function_name`
-   On the right, we have the description of the function

Usually, functions have names that are representative of what they do.
This makes it easier to use. Remember this if you ever start to write
your own functions!

Here the result that interests us is `base::seq`, i.e. the function
`seq` that can be found in the `base` package and that generates
sequences.\
**Note**: the `base` package contains basic functions that load with R
when you launch it and are therefore always available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Help page of functions

We will use the `seq()` function to generate our sequence. But how does
it work? What does it do? How should I use it?

To answer all these questions, we'll try to find the help page of the
function. For that, we will use the `?` operator (or the `help()`
function). To access the help page of a function, we enter the commage
as follow: `?function_name`

So for the `seq()` function, we type:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?seq
```

This opens the following page:

![](images/searchseq.png){.align-center width="600"}\

A help page usually contains the folowing elements and sections (*Note*:
sometimes, the same help page is used for more than one function):

-   On the top left corner, the name of the function and the package it
    belongs to in the format `function{package}`
-   **Description**: a short description of the function(s)
-   **Usage**: how to use the function(s), especially what are the name
    and order of the arguments. If a value is specified near an argument
    name, it means that a default value has been defined for this
    argument, which makes it optional to specify another value. If the
    argument is missing, the default value will be used. For example, if
    we do not provide a `from` argument, the sequence will automatically
    start from **1**
-   **Arguments**: A detailed description of all the arguments and what
    is expected or required for the function to work correctly. Be
    careful! Here are listed all the arguments for all the functions
    described on the help page; not all arguments are available for all
    listed functions. For example, in this help page, the arguments
    `from` and `to` are not available for the function `seq_along()`.
-   **Details**: Provide in depth details of the inner working of the
    function(s). Some specific cases can be discussed here or
    additionnal information provided.
-   **Value**: Explains what the return value of the function is.
-   **References**: Sources used as basis for the function or
    interesting readings on the subject.
-   **See Also**: Related functions that can sometimes be of use,
    especially when searching for the correct function for our needs.
-   **Examples**: Some examples on how to use the function(s)

## Challenge 13

- Create a sequence of even numbers from 0 to 10 using the seq function

- Create an unsorted vector of your favourite numbers. Sort your vector in reverse order.

*Hint: Find out how to sort it using `?sort`.*

### Solutions

- Create a sequence of even numbers from 0 to 10 using the seq function

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)
```

We could also have written

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
seq(0, 10, 2)
```

- Create an unsorted vector of your favourite numbers.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
numbers <- c(2, 4, 22, 6, 26)
sort(numbers, decreasing = TRUE)
```

## Getting help on the Web

Usually, your best source of information will be your favorite search
engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.)

Here are some tips on how to use them efficiently:

-   Search in English
-   Use the keyword "R" at the beginning of your search
-   Define precisely what you are looking for
-   Learn to read discussion forums. Chances are other people already
    had the same problem and asked about it. Create your account on
    forums where questions about R are often asked like
    [stackexchange](http://stats.stackexchange.com).
-   Don't hesitate to search again with different keywords!
