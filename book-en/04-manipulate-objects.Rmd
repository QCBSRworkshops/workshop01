# Manipulating objects in R

## Objects

You have learned so far how to use R as a calculator to obtain various
numerical values. However, it can get tiresome to always write the same
code down in the R console, especially if you have to use some values
repeatedly. This is where the concept of object becomes useful.

R is an object-oriented programming language. What this means is that we
can allocate a name to values we've created to save them in our
workspace. An object is composed of three parts: 1) a value we're
interested in, 2) an identifier and 3) the assignment operator.

1.  The value can be almost anything we want: a number, the result of a
    calculation, a string of characters, a data frame, a plot or a
    function.
2.  The identifier is the name you assign to the value. Whenever you
    want to refer to this value, you simply type the identifier in the R
    console and R will return its value. Identifiers can include only
    letters, numbers, periods and underscores, and should always begin
    with a letter.
3.  The assignment operator resembles an arrow (`<-`) and is used to
    link the value to the identifier.

The following code clarifies these ideas:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Let's create an object called mean_x.
# The # symbol is used in R to indicate comments. It is not processed by R.
# It is important to add comments to code so that it can be understood and used by other people.
mean_x <- (2 + 6) / 2
# Typing its name will return its value.
> mean_x
[1]  4
```

Here, `(2 + 6) / 2` is the value you want to save as an object. The
identifier `mean_x` is assigned to this value. Typing `mean_x` returns
the value of the calculation (*i.e.* 4). You have to be scrupulous when
typing the identifier because R is case-sensitive: writing `mean_x` is
not the same as writing `MEAN_X`. You can see that the assignment
operator `<-` creates an explicit link between the value and the
identifier. It always points from the value to the identifier. Note that
it is also possible to use the equal sign `=` as the assignment operator
but [it is preferable
not](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/assignment-operators-in-r-and)
to because it is also used for other operations in R, which can cause
problems when using it for assignment. Finally, imagine that the
operator `<-` and `=` follow their own order of priorities.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> y <- x = 5
Error in y <- x = 5 : object 'y' not found
> y = x <- 5
> y
[1] 5
> x
[1] 5

```



#### Good practices in R code

**Name**

-   Try having short and explicit names for your variables. Naming a
    variable `var` is not very informative.
-   Use an underscore (`_`), or a dot (`.`) to separate words within a
    name and try to be consistent!
-   Avoid using names of existing functions and variables (e.g., `c`,
    `table`, `T`, etc.)

**Space**

1.  Add spaces around all operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.) to make
    the code more readable.
2.  Always put a space after a comma, and never before (like in regular
    English).



##### CHALLENGE 5

> Create an object with a value of 1 + 1.718282 (Euler's number) and
> name it `euler_value`

 Challenge 5: Solution

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> euler_value <- 1 + 1.718282
```





##### CHALLENGE 6

> Create an object (you decide the value) with a name that starts with a
> number. What happens?

 Challenge 6: Solution An object name that starts with a number
will return the following error:
`unexpected symbol in "your object name"`. 



**R TIP**

Using the Tab key allows auto-completion of names. It speeds up command
entering and avoids spelling errors. For example, if you type `eu` and
then press tab, you will see a list of objects or functions beginning
with `eu`. Select `euler_value` (the object we just created) and press
enter. The `euler_value` identifier now appears at the command line.


## Data types and structure

Using R to analyze your data is an important aspect of this software.
Data comes in different forms and can be grouped in distinct categories.
Depending on the nature of the values enclosed inside your data or
object, R classifies them accordingly. The following figure illustrates
common objects found in R.

![Types of objects in R](// imageobjr.png){.align-center width="500"}

The first object is a **vector**. It is one of the most common objects
in R. A vector is an entity consisting of a list of related values. All
values in a vector must be the same mode. The main modes in R are
**numeric**, **character** and **logical**. Numeric vectors are made of
numbers only. Character vectors include text strings or a mix of text
strings and other modes. You need to use `""` to delimit elements in a
character vector. Logical vectors include `TRUE/FALSE` entries only. A
vector with a single value (usually a constant) is called an atomic
vector.

Before we look at how to create different types of vectors, let's have
a look at the generic method of creating vectors. If you recall what you
have just learned, you will first have to identify some value you want
to put in a vector and then link it to an identifier with the assignment
operator (*i.e.* create an object). When you have more than one value in
a vector, you need a way to tell R to group all these values to create a
vector. The trick here is to use the `c()` function. Don't worry, you
will learn about functions pretty soon in one of the following sections.
For now, just remember to put your values between parentheses next to
letter `c()` in this format:
`vector.name <- c(value1, value2, value3, ...)`. The function `c()`
means combine or concatenate. It is a quick and easy function so
remember it!

Now that you know the generic method to create a vector in R, let's
have a look at how to create different types of vectors.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Create a numeric vector with the c (which means combine or concatenate) function.
# We will learn about functions soon!
> num_vector <- c(1, 4, 3, 98, 32, -76, -4)

# Create a character vector. Always use "" to delimit text strings!
> char_vector <- c("blue", "red", "green")

# Create a logical or boolean vector. Don't use "" or R will consider this as text strings.
> bool_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

#It is also possible to use abbreviations for logical vectors.
> bool_vector2 <- c(T, T, F)
```



##### CHALLENGE 7

> Create a vector containing the first five odd numbers (starting from
> 1) and name it odd_n.

Challenge 7: Solution

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> odd_n <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```





**R TIP**

Use `dput()` function to obtain the reverse, *i.e.* the content of an
object formatted as a vector. *e.g.* :

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> odd_n <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
> odd_n
[1] 1 3 5 7 9

> dput(odd_n)
c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

# The output can be copied-pasted to create a new object by using the structure() function
> structure(c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9))
```

This demonstration might not be that convincing, but keep in mind that
it can be very useful when you're manipulating data. These functions
are really useful to provide a reproducible example for a question on
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for instance (see one more
application in the part about data frames)!



What you have learned previously about calculations is also valid for
vectors: vectors can be used for calculations. The only difference is
that when a vector has more than 1 element, the operation is applied on
all elements of the vector. The following example clarifies this.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Create two numeric vectors.
> x <- 1:5

# An equivalent form is: x <- c(1:5).
> y <- 6
# Remember that the : symbol, when used with numbers, is the sequence operator.
# It tells R to create a series of numbers increasing by 1.
# Equivalent to this is x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# Let's sum both vectors.
# 6 is added to all elements of the x vector.
> x + y
[1]  7 8 9 10 11

# Let's multiply x by itself.
> x * y
[1]  6 12 18 24 30

```



Another important type of object you will use regularly is the data
frame. A data frame is a group of vectors of the same length (*i.e.* the
same number of elements). Columns are always variables and rows are
observations, cases, sites or replicates. Different modes can be saved
in different columns (but always the same mode in a column). It is in
this format that ecological data are usually stored. The following
example shows a fictitious dataset representing 4 sites where soil pH
and the number of plant species were recorded. There is also a
"Treatment" variable (fertilized or not). Let's have a look at the
creation of a data frame.

  site_id   soil_pH   num_sp   treatment
  --------- --------- -------- ----------------
  A1.01     5.6       17       Fertilised
  A1.02     7.3       23       Fertilised
  B1.01     4.1       15       Not Fertilised
  B1.02     6.0       17       Not Fertilised

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# We first start by creating vectors.
> site_id <- c("A1.01", "A1.02", "B1.01", "B1.02")
> soil_pH <- c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6.0)
> num_sp <- c(17, 23, 15, 7)
> treatment <- c("Fert", "Fert", "No_fert", "No_fert")

# We then combine them to create a data frame with the data.frame function.
my_df <- data.frame(site_id, soil_pH, num_sp, treatment)

# Visualise it!
my_df
```


\*\* R TIP\*\*

Here the `dput()` function in another example.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> dput(my_df)
structure(list(site_id = c("A1.01", "A1.02", "B1.01", "B1.02"
), soil_pH = c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6), num_sp = c(17, 23, 15, 7),
treatment = c("Fert", "Fert", "No_fert", "No_fert")),
class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -4L))

# It's possible to rebuild the initial data frame (with some associated metadata as the class of variables) by copying and pasting the previous output:
> structure(list(site_id = c("A1.01", "A1.02", "B1.01", "B1.02"
), soil_pH = c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6), num_sp = c(17, 23, 15, 7),
treatment = c("Fert", "Fert", "No_fert", "No_fert")),
class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -4L))
```



Other types of objects include matrices, arrays and lists. A matrix is
similar to a data frame except that all cells in the matrix must be the
same mode. An array is similar to a matrix but can have more than two
dimensions. Arrays are usually used for advanced computation like
numerical simulations and permutation tests. A list is an aggregation of
various types of objects. For example, a list could include a vector, a
data frame and a matrix in the same object.


## Indexing

#### Indexing a vector

Typing an object's name in R returns the complete object. But what if
our object is a huge data frame with millions of entries? It can easily
become confusing to identify specific elements of an object. R allows us
to extract only part of an object. This is called indexing. We specify
the position of values we want to extract from an object with brackets
`[ ]`. The following code illustrates the concept of indexation with
vectors.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Let's first create a numeric and a character vector.
# There is no need to do this again if you already did it in the previous exercise!
> odd_n <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

# Extract the second element of the numeric vector.
> odd_n[2]
[1]  3

# Extract the second and fourth elements of the numeric vector.
> odd_n[c(2, 4)]
[1]  3 7

# Extract all but the two first elements of the numeric vector.
> odd_n[c(-1, -2)]
[1] 5 7 9

# If you select a position that is not in the numeric vector
> odd_n[c(1,6)]
[1] 1 NA
# There is no sixth value in this vector so R returns a null value (i.e. NA)
# NA stands for 'Not available'.

# You can use logical statement to select values.
> odd_n[odd_n > 4]
[1] 5 7 9

# Extract all elements of the character vector corresponding exactly to "blue".
> char_vecteur[char_vecteur == "blue"]
[1]  "bleu"
# Note the use of the double equal sign ==.

```

##### CHALLENGE 9

> Explore the difference between these 2 lines of code:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> char_vector == "blue"
> char_vector[char.vector == "blue"]
```

Challenge 9: Differences between codes\| In the first line of code
you test a logical statement. For each entry in the "char_vector"
vector, R checks whether the entry is exactly equal to "blue" or not
and returns a TRUE/FALSE answer. The next subsection introduces you to
logical statements. In the second line of code you ask R to extract all
values within the "char_vector" vector that are exactly equal to
"blue". It is also possible to extract the "blue" value by assigning
a logical value to each element of the vector. Of course, you have to
know the position of the "blue" value inside the vector.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
> char_vector[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
[1] "blue"
# We specify which value is true,
# i.e. the value we want R to return (the first one)
# which corresponds to "blue".
```





#### Indexing a data frame

For data frames, the concept of indexation is similar, but we usually
have to specify two dimensions: the row and column numbers. The R syntax
is

`dataframe[row number, column number]`.

Here are a few examples of data frame indexation. Note that the first
four operations are also valid for indexing matrices.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Let's reuse the data frame we created earlier (my_df)
# Extract the 1st row of the data frame
> my_df[1, ]

# Extract the 3rd columm
> my_df[, 3]

# Extract the 2nd element of the 4th column
> my_df[2, 4]

# Extract lines 2 to 4
> my_df[c(2,4), ]

# Extract the "site_id" column by referring directly to its name
# The dollar sign ($) allows such an operation!
> my_df$site_id

# Extract the "site_id" and "soil_pH" variables
> my_df[, c("site_id","soil_pH")]
```



### A quick note on logical statements

R gives you the possibility to test logical statements, *i.e.* to
evaluate whether a statement is true or false. You can compare objects
with the following logical operators:

  Operator   Description
  ---------- --------------------------
  \<         less than
  \<=        less than or equal to
  \>         greater than
  \>=        greater than or equal to
  ==         exactly equal to
  !=         not equal to
  x \| y     x OR y
  x & y      x AND y

The following examples illustrate how to use these operators properly.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# First, let's create two vectors for comparison.
> x2 <- c(1:5)
> y2 <- c(1, 2, -7, 4, 5).

# Let's verify if the elements in x2 are greater or equal to 3.
# R returns a TRUE/FALSE value for each element (in order).
> x2 >= 3
[1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE

# Let's see if the elements of x2 are exactly equal to those of y2.
> x2 == y2
[1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE

# Is 3 not equal to 4? Of course!
> 3 != 4
[1] TRUE

# Let's see which values in x2 are greater than 2 but smaller than 5.
# You have to write x2 twice.
# If you write x2 > 2 & < 5, you will get an error message.
> x2 > 2 & x2 < 5
[1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE
```
